I appreciate you sharing the context, but I need to clarify what you're looking for. 

Based on your request "Complete application for property management," are you asking me to create: 

1. **A web/mobile application** (software product) for managing properties?
2. **An application form** (document/form) that prospective tenants, property owners, or vendors fill out?
3. **Application code** (repository structure) for a property management system?

Also, what's your intended use case? 
- Is this for a **GitHub repository** you want to set up? 
- Do you need a **form template** (PDF, Word, or web form)?
- Do you need **full-stack application code** (frontend + backend)?

Once you clarify, I can help you create: 
- A complete GitHub repository with all necessary files
- Full-stack code (React/Vue frontend + Node.js/Python backend)
- Database schema and API documentation
- Ready-to-use form templates
- Application forms with validation

What would be most helpful?  🙂
